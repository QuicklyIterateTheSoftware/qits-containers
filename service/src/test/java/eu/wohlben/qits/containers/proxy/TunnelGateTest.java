/**
 * The shipped posture: {@code qits.containers.proxy.enabled} is false, so the data plane is designed
 * and switched off. This class is what makes "off" a measured state rather than an assumption.
 *
 * <p><b>It runs on {@link FakeDriverProfile} deliberately</b> — the profile with no config overrides
 * at all — because the claim is about the value the jar ships and not about a value a test set. A
 * profile that turned the gate off explicitly would pass just as happily against a jar shipping it
 * on.
 *
 * <p>The three cases are the three surfaces the flag has to cover, and none of them substitutes for
 * another: a socket that refuses, a route that 404s, and a bean that binds nothing.
