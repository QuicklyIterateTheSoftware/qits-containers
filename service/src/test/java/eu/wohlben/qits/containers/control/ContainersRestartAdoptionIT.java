/**
 * <b>The headline claim of this whole repository, against a real docker daemon: a restart of this
 * service is invisible to a container that is still running.</b>
 *
 * <p>Everything else here is proved against a scripted fake, which is what keeps a clone's
 * {@code ./mvnw verify} docker-free — and a fake can only ever say that the code does what the fake
 * was told to expect. Adoption is the one claim that has to be made against the daemon: what is
 * asserted is that a container's docker {@code Id} and {@code StartedAt} are <b>unchanged</b>
 * afterwards, and those two numbers only exist on a host.
 *
 * <p>The arrangement is a crash, reproduced exactly:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>a container is started through the service's own REST surface, so the row and the container
 *       are the ones production would have made;
 *   <li>its row is flipped back to {@code PENDING} — the state a process that died between
 *       {@code docker run} and the answer leaves, and the arm of the sweep that adopts;
 *   <li>a container this registry names nothing about is started beside it, by the test, directly;
 *   <li>{@link BootSweep#sweepOnce()} and {@link ContainerObserver#observeOnce()} run, which is
 *       what a restart runs and in the order a restart runs them.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The assertions are three, and the third is the one that would catch a reap:
 * the row says {@code RUNNING} with {@code [adopted at startup]} on it; the container's id and
 * start time did not move, so nothing restarted it; and the <b>unlabelled bystander is still
 * running</b>. A sweep that listed the host rather than its rows would have taken that one, and
 * that sweep is the regression this repository was built to remove.
 *
 * <p><b>It lives in {@code control} rather than beside the driver</b> for
 * {@code CiRestartReconciliationIT}'s reason: {@code sweepOnce} and {@code observeOnce} are
 * package-private there by design — the suite is meant to drive them and no other module may — and
 * a test that had to make them public to reach them would have widened the seam it is testing. The
 * beans are the <b>injected</b> ones, so what runs is the deployment's configured driver against
 * the deployment's configured runtime.
 *
 * <p>Tagged {@code extended}: it needs a reachable docker daemon and it starts real containers, so
 * it is out of the default build and out of the {@code -Dnative} gate. Run it with
 * {@code ./mvnw verify -DskipITs=false}. It skips cleanly when there is no daemon, and it removes
 * everything it started — its own place through the service's {@code destroyAll}, the bystander by
 * hand, in a {@code finally}.
