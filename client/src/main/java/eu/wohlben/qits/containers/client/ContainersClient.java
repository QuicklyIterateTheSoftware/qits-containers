/**
 * How a consumer calls qits-containers: one class, one {@code HttpClient}, and four answers per
 * call.
 *
 * <p><b>A plain class, and framework-free on purpose.</b> Nothing here is annotated, nothing is
 * injected, and this jar depends on neither quarkus-arc nor any OIDC extension. A consumer makes it
 * a bean with a producer of its own — three lines, and the README has them — which is what lets a
 * daemon that runs no container construct one with {@code new} and lets a Quarkus service configure
 * it exactly as it configures everything else. The defaults it needs ship in this jar's
 * {@code META-INF/microprofile-config.properties} at ordinal 100, so that producer names keys
 * rather than values.
 *
 * <p><b>The base URL is scheme + host + port with NO path</b>, the platform shape that
 * {@code qits.events.url} and {@code qits.ci.git-host-url} follow: the address is a deployment fact
 * and the path is the client's knowledge. This class appends {@link #CONTAINERS_PATH} and
 * {@link #VOLUMES_PATH} itself, so a base with a path in it yields a doubled one and a 404 nothing
 * retries out of.
 *
 * <p><b>Every call is synchronous and bounded.</b> Synchronous because a caller has to know which
 * of the four happened before it decides whether to record anything; bounded because these calls sit
 * on the caller's own thread — for qits-ci, the single-threaded run worker between one pipeline
 * step and the next — and an unbounded wait there parks every pipeline on the instance behind one
 * unreachable service. The deadline is a method parameter with a config-backed default, and
 * {@code ensure} has a much longer one than everything else because it may be waiting on an image
 * pull.
 *
 * <p><b>No method throws.</b> Every failure this client can meet is one of the four answers, which
 * is the property that makes the {@code switch} at the call site total. An {@code InterruptedException}
 * is {@link Unreachable} with the flag restored: the caller is a worker being asked to stop, so
 * nothing was learned about the workload.

   *
   * <p><b>Pinned to HTTP/1.1, and that is not a preference.</b> The JDK client defaults to HTTP/2
   * with an {@code h2c} upgrade, and an upgrade that carries a request body delivers that body
   * <em>twice</em> — measured against qits-eventstream's test stub, where one PUT arrived through
   * the server's upgrade handler and again as an HTTP/2 data frame ninety milliseconds later.

   * {@code PUT .../ensure}, whose second delivery races the first through a registry that is
