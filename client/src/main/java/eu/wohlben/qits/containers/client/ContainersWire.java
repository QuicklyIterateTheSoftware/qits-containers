/**
 * Everything qits-containers accepts and answers, as a caller names it.
 *
 * <p><b>These mirror the service's own wire records rather than being them.</b> The service module
 * has a {@code ContainersWire} of its own and neither jar sees the other: the agreement is the JSON
 * body, and each side names its own types over it. That is what lets a consumer be built, tested
 * and released without this repository on its classpath at all — and it is the same trade the poms
 * here make with their duplicated versions.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here validates anything.</b> The belts are the service's, where a refusal can name
 * the field and come back as a 400 with {@code INVALID} on it. A record that checked its own
 * arguments would turn that into an exception thrown before the request left, in a caller that has
 * no way to report it, and the two sets of rules would drift the first time the service's widened.
 *
 * <p><b>The enums are restated, and a value this client does not know reads as null.</b> The
 * service's catalogue grows — {@code ObservedState} has gained a value before — and a client that
 * threw on an unrecognised word would turn "the service learned something" into a broken consumer
 * that has to be released in lock step. See {@link ContainersJson} for the mapper flag that makes
 * that true and for what it costs.
